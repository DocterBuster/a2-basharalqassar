Design Achievements for A2:


Single-page App:

Entering the appropriate information in all three fields on the webpage will create a new filed derived from
Score / time, which is calculated on the server and shown immediately on the client.


Modifying Existing Data:

Entering a name that already exists on the table in the username filed
will update their existing information, except for the date (which was an intentional choice)


Web Testing with other students:

I was only able to get 1 other student to test my application, and I forgot their name (Very tight on time)
(but apparently they are crediting me if that will matter)
They tested my app in an extremely early stage that only had information submission working,
They did comment however, on the fact it was intuitive in its simple nature, so I kept the app's design
simple and understandable throughout.
